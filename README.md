# corelibs-galileo

The contents of this repo is distributed through releases in Arduino IDE.    
`Tools > Board > Boards Manager > Intel i586 Boards by Intel`

If you wish to use the latest **untested** changes, follow these instructions.

1. Install the latest `Intel i586 Boards by Intel` from `Boards Manager`
2. Download the [latest snapshot](https://github.com/01org/corelibs-galileo/archive/master.zip)
   of this repo
3. Shut down the IDE
4. Go to Arduino15 directory
  * Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Arduino15`
  * OS X: `~/Library/Arduino15`
  * Linux: `~/.arduino15`
5. Go to `packages/Intel/hardware/i586/<version>/`
6. Delete the content of the directory from step 5, and replace it with the
   content of the "corelibs-edison-master" folder in the zip from step 2.

Future upgrades may fail since the internal contents were modified by hand. In
order to recover, shut down the IDE, delete the entire `Arduino15` directory,
then restart the IDE.

## Examples of things that should go in the Issue tracker

> "I noticed that your DoSomeThing library doesn't support all the same
> modes as the library from SomeOtherGuy: https://link-to-relevant-thing.com
> Can you add support for these modes?"

> "If I run example sketch X on a Galileo board, I get result Y. But if I
> run the same sketch on an Arduino UNO board, I get result Z. This looks like
> a bug to me."

## Examples of things that should go in the support forum

> "I'm having trouble downloading the Galileo boards package in the Arduino
> IDE Boards Manager"

> "How do I use this library?"
